# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
<!-- The html written, and the view source is not the dom. The html is formated by your browser and turned into the dom. The view source just you the html, which is similar to the html you wrote, just compiled using a build process  -->
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
<!-- It is sorta, it is a visual representation of the dom. It is a compiling of different code and simplifies them so that it is easier to ready through. -->
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
<!-- It a visual basis for us to view the code of live websites. This is important for us to study how coders structure and write code as a standard.  -->
```
