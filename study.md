# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not the HTML that is sent from the server and the DOM is not the source as shown by the browswer when asked to "View Source...", even though they all have similar visualizations through the tools in the browswer.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The information in dev tools is a representation of the DOM, not the DOM iteself. The representation of the DOM we see in the Dev Tools can be modified programatically by a web application or even by the browswer itself.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it provides a standardized tree structure to represent and HTML page that can be easily navigated and manipulated through JavaScript. This enables software to dynamically manipulate what the user sees in the browser without having to reload an entire page.
```
