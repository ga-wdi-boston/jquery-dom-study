# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
-It is not your HTML file. However, it is made using your html code.
-The ViewSource option is not the DOM, it is essentially the same as looking at your html code, unless its been modified, added, removed etc.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The information inside the DevTools is like the DOM because it is a visual representation of it. It is the result of what your code looks like once you have used the DevTools to look at it It is possible that the code has been altered with something like javascript, so the Dev tools will show you something different than your html file does.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
I think the DOM can be extremely useful for many things. One example would be in case you need to look at the DOM of a web page that you need to fix. If this web page has an error loading something in, it is possible you could catch that by looking at the DOM.
```
