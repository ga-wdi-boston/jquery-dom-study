# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not HTML because HTML is a language whereas DOM is a model for
specifying interfaces to display HTML
The DOM is not viewable through 'View Source' as that displays the HTML. DOM
can be viewed through Dev Tools.

```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes the information inside Dev Tools is the DOM because it provides
a visual representation of the DOM.

```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM serves as a middleman between the HTML/CSS and the rendered document/
browser. It defines a structure to the document that allows languages like
JavaScript to interact with the document style and content. It offers a way to
navigate and search through a document.
