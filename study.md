# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not source HTML (from "view source") and it is not a rendered page.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, the browser makes the DOM based on the html it is showing.
It will fix errors for us, and complete the code so that it can be displayed.
So, the code that is shown in the dev tools may be different than the HTML we originally wrote.
It is a visual represenation of the DOM. Really though, the DOM is a convention that has
become the way that JavaScript access parts of a page e.g. getElementByID to select
an element with a certain ID.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is an easy way to access parts of the page using JavaScript. It lets you have
dynamic and highly functional and interactive web-pages.
```
