# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not your HTML that you wrote and it is also not the final rendered
web page.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The Dev Tools contains a visual representation of the DOM that you can edit
temporarily to see ideas being rendered.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it allows you to use javascript to enable
interactivity with the users and manipulate the page in response to events such
as users clicking buttons or the page fully loading.
```
