# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is _not_ your HTML, nor is it the content we see in "view source"!
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The information we see inside Dev Tools is _kinda_ the DOM. It will reflect
any changes made by JavaScript/jQuery to the HTML content that were not included
in the original HTML document, as well as any elements the browser automatically
inserts that we may have omitted in the document.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it allows us to access / manipulate the HTML with
JavaScript and jQuery.
```
