# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
Dom is not a flat markup language, needs to be always in the pair with html if we want to see the content not only in the console but also in the browser window.

Dom is not view source.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, the tags with notes in the browser inspect element tool are part of the tree structure as called the document object model.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important for taking a markup language like html and transfer it into the structure that can access a serve side of the website and request some information on that end to shoot back to the web browser where we can see the data rendered. It's used a lot for links and forms.
