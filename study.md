# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Is this a question?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not a source and not a rendered page.

I think of it as slots that you can put information in or take out based on events or commands.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Information is neither in the Dev tools nor the DOM. Dev tools are merely tools to help you debug or see what is served to the DOM. Dev tools can help with things such as running javascript line by line in order to find a problem or manipulating styling.

The DOM is merely a portal or structure layout waiting to be fed new data or manipulated as it is served more data. The real data is held in things like the javascript file or other files that send data to the DOM.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM provides structure.

It provides braches or piping to add to, fill in, manipulate etc, and for the client to see and interact with. Without the DOM, there would be no layout structure or nodes to append to.
```
