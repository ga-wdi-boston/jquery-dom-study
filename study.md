# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not the html you write, nor is it the 'view source'.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
It isn't exactly the DOM but it is a visual representation of the original html code as
well as the js that manipulated it.  It may not reflect the original html as it was coded.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is an excellent method of representing the actual page in a 'tree' model.  It helps to define how the document will be rendered and manipulated.
```
