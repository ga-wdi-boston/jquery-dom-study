# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
1)html
2)the rendered page in the browser
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
kindof, it depends which developer tools you're using.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
THe DOM is important because it gives a concise picture of what your website looks like and also shows you how differnt parts are related to each other. It also lets you access your html without actually having to go into your html doc.
```
