    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The HTML I write
What appears in 'view source'
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Its a visual represtation of the DOM. The DOM is created when the browser parses HTML I write.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
When using Javascript, JQuery or anything else to interact with a page, its interacting with the DOM, not the original HTML directly. 
```
