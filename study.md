## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not the HTML you write. [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/)
The DOM is not the HTML in the "view source" window of your browser. [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/)
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, kind of. The tree-like structure in the Elements panel is the closest representation of the DOM since it is the current view after the browser has fixed any errors and after any javascript may have changed the DOM. [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/)
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
One reason that the DOM is important is that it provides a rigid standard and model for HTML and XML documents. It also provides a means, via its manipulation through, say, JavaScript, to implement client-side interactivity.
