# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
Not a source or a rendered page.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
According to the css tricks resources, more or less. It is the HTML rendered through the DOM. The primary difference appears to be that the DOM fixes non-fatal flaws in your HTML before it renders it.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
Basically, the DOM makes it possible for developers to actually interact with the HTML they wrote. The DOM is a go-between, allowing javascript code to act upon HTML code. Without the DOM, the internet as we know it would be impossible, as the only way to act upon devices would be with the unintuitive and user-unfreindly terminal.
```
