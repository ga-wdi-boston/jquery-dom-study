# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
the DOM IS NOT an html file alone, nor is the DOM a JavaScript file
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
YES, in a way because it renders the DOM in it.
It shows it within the Dev tools so that you can edit it live.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
To understand the organizational hierarchy of a Document that is going through a web page.
to see the different files in a structured format to see how they relate to eachother can
help to have you understand whats going on when you are linking different files to eachother--
say though linking a JavaScript file to an HTML file you can see visually and spatially how they
are connected and what each are coming from.
```
