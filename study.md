# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not a direct copy of your html.  It uses your HTML to create the document, but it turns every HTML element into an object that can be manipulated.  The DOM also is not the content of 'view page source'.  We can access the DOM through the developer tools.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
This information is not the DOM itself, but rather a visual representation of the DOM.  It allows us to highlight objects and see where their content is on the page.  It also allows us to communicate with the DOM to manipulate the page's HTML.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it allows us to interact with web pages to add, remove, and change HTML content.  It is useful because these changes can be made without having to rewrite large sections of HTML and re-upload them to the server.
```
