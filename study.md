## Required Readings

    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
It is neither the HTML nor the View Source.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes.  It visually shows the DOM and how it organized the HTML.

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
It connects the web page to the programming language like Javascript.  It organizes
the everything in the document so that the programming language can come in and make it useful.
The DOM is like a yard sale.  It takes and organizes all the junk in your garage
and puts it on your front lawn so people can come and interact with it/but it for 50 cents.
```
