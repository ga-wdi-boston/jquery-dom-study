# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
- The DOM is not the same as the HTML. It is only a visual representation of
  HTML.
- The DOM is a language independent model of the page. It is not a part of
  HTML or JavaScript, but follows a separate set of rules.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
I think DOM view is available in Dev Tools, hence the information inside
Dev Tools is available in the DOm.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
DOM is important to provide a standard programming interface that can be used
in a wide variety of environment and applications.
```
