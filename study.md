# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
1. The HTML you write.
2. View Source
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, what you see in your Dev Tools is the DOM. My guess is that Dev Tools shows
you the DOM so you can see the full effect of your JavaScript on the HTML you originally
wrote.  If the Dev Tools only showed you your true HTML, you wouldn't be getting a full
picture.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
As mentioned above, the DOM gives you the big picture.  You can see your HTML as
interpeted by your browser, along with any modifications made by JavaScript/jQuery.
The DOM is also important as it provides a layer between your HTML and JavaScript.
You can impact the look of your site and make it interactive without actually
modifying any of the underlying HTML.
```
