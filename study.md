## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
HTML and 'View source'
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, because it takes your html and creates a visual representation
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
it allows you to write javascript and interact with it
```
