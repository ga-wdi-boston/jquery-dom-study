# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
HTML is not the DOM.
View source is not the DOM either.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
It is the DOM. It shows visual representation of the DOM. DOM is created from HTML. But it isn't always the same as our HTML.
For example, if we have <table> tag but forget to add <tbody> tag,the browser will add it for us, and it will be within our DOM, but not HTML.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
Since the DOM represents an HTML, XHTML and XML document as a tree structure where every node is an object, using the DOM we can easily access every single one of them and manipulate those elements.
```
