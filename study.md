# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not the html you write. Using 'view source' is not the DOM.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Not exactly. It is a visual representation of the DOM.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it allows the browser to show your webpage. It
gives the structure to the website and translates your code into something
the browser can work with.
```
