# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not:
  1.  The static rendered HTML page (i.e. index.html) written by a developer
  2.  The `view source` for a specific browser

```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes.  The DOM is created directly from the static HTML (i.e. index.html) when a
web page loads or is rendered.  Dev Tools (within a browser) shows the current
state of the DOM at run time.

```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important as it "cleans up" mistakes with the HTML.  It also is used
to find elements within the HTML as well as manipulate content and styles using
JavaScript.
It can also listen for user events (i.e. mouse clicks, browser resizing, button
clicks, data input) as well as provide support for animation of web page elements.
