# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not the view source.
The DOM is not the written HTML or Javascript.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The information inside Dev Tools is the visual representation of the DOM. It resembles
a tree like structure where the HTML elements become "nodes," identifying a relationship
between the elements. It provides another way to see the web page with scripting
language and HTML source in the browser window.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
All objects represented in the DOM are available for access and manipulation.
Javascript, the language of the web, is simply a language, thus without the DOM
every element in the document would be inaccessible.

When the browser starts receiving HTML from the web page, it loads it pieces by piece
into the DOM, and Javascript enables us to interact with the DOM.
```
