# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
Firstly, the DOM is not the HTML you write, rather it is the browser's interpretation of it. Secondly, 'View Source' is not the DOM, as the source has not integrated any changes made by other files such as javascript or by the browser.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
It is, more or less. This is because it includes not only changes to the HTML generated by the acompanying files and by teh browser.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
Because it create a standardized hirarcy making it easier to plan and execute the layout of a web page.
```
