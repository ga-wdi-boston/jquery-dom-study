## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents

Its NOT:  a language or a servier
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, the DOM the kind of like the tree you see on the right on the browswer, when you click inspect.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
It helps to have convention to commmunicate with different servers.
