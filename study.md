# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The Document Object Model is not the actual HTML that is written.  The DOM is also not what is seen within View Source.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, the HTML seen in Dev Tools is the DOM.  This is created, for the most part, from the code that is written.  Some pieces of content in the Dev Tools could be different from what is written if there was a mistake in the written code and the browser has automatically fixed it.
Also, the effects of Javascipt code that manipulates HTML can be seen in the DOM even though it is not seen in the developers' written code.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because we can see a overall view of the nodes that have built the webpage and the relationships of these nodes with eachother.  The DOM will show us where the node elements came from if it is not direclty from the developers code.  



```
