# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not HTML, nor is it View Source, nor is it Jackie Chan.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
It seems to be the most DOM like thing you can view in Chrome, it shows the current status of all elements in the DOM, allows manipulation of the DOM and the DOM tree, but it is not itself the DOM which is an API and a model for HTML, XML, and others.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important to society because it provides a standardised structure for HTML, XML etc. It is important to me because it shows me the missing link between what I write in atom, and what I see on the screen in the browser.
```
