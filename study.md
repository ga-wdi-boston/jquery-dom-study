Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not the following:

-source
-a rendered page

```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
It is a visual representation of the DOM - showing the nodes and the tree structure.  It is created from the HTML that was written, and is a structured  representation of it.

```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?


```md
The DOM is important because it gives us a standard avenue through which we can interact with elements on a web page using JavaSript and Jquery.
