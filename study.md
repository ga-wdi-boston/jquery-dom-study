## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The doctype or the view source.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Kind of. It's a convention for representing objects in html. So, when a browser is directed to the html code you wrote, the dom performs additional work and manipulates it, and is the visual representation of waht you see.

```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
It seems like it takes all html writted, logically organizes it, and displays it the best way for the browswer, without changing your original html code. 
```
