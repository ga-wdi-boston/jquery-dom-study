# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not a type of programing language.
The DOM is not a web page.

(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The information inside Dev Tools is not the DOM. The tools, like the browser,
can only interact with the DOM. The DOM is a different form of the same information
created by the Dev Tools.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it gives a unified interface for HTML, and other document
types. The DOM allows for standardized manipualtion of these types of documents
and their elements across different platforms.
```
