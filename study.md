## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
1) The HTML you write.
2) 'View Source'
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, because it's a visial representaion of the DOM. ```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
I think the DOM is important because it's where things happen. Everything kind of goes to it...if you will.```
