# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
1)The DOM is not a set of data structures, it's a object model that specifies interface
2)The DOM is not an HTML webpage, it is an API that lets one interact with the HTML/XML webpage

source: https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-1/introduction.html
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
To a certain extent; both behave in similar ways in the sense that they're both dynamic
 the DOM is more of a tree diagram that represents the different content inside a HTML doc
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
It allows someone to modify the HTML content without actually changing any of it in the
original source page and allows HTML content to be more interactive
```
