# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
1. The DOM is not html even if you 'view source'.
2. The DOM is not a programming language.
3. The DOM is not the rendered page.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The information available in the Dev Tools of a web browser is a visual
representation of the DOM, which looks like the HTML someone might have used to
write the page, since it was generated from it. It follows the node/tree
structure that a DOM is made up of and allows you to access individual elements
in the DOM just like JavaScript is able to.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it gives us the ability to access, modify, remove,
insert, and otherwise work with nodes in the DOM structure that directly affects
what happens on the webpage. Further, the DOM is useful because it gives us
a defined structure and heirarchy for those elements and how they can interact
with each other and the user (such as Event Listeners or mouse clicks on the page).
```
