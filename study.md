# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
It is not the HTML you wrote, nor what you see with the "view source" button
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Kind of. It's a visual representation of the DOM, so it can be identical to your HTML,
unless you have a website that has been manipulated by Javascript. In that case, the DOM is what results of that Javascript
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?


```md
The DOM is what your website looks like with the Javascript working. It gives you dynamic elements and allows manipulation your page without actually changing the HTML you wrote originally.
```
