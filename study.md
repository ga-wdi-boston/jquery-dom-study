# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
1) The DOM is not the HTML I write.
2) The DOM is not the view source of the page I look at.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes - what you see in DevTools is a visual representation of the DOM and it can
be accessed to change the structure, style, and content of the web page.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
I think the DOM is important in order for us to see our web pages in the way we
envision them! Without it, our code would not communicate with the web page to
its fullest potential.
```
