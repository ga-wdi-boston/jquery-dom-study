# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md

https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html:
1) The DOM is not a web page.
2) The DOM is not the index.html document.
3)
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html:

Yes. The Dev Tools can access the tree structure of the data. The DOM makes the document accessible to the user.

```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM allows th basis for Single Page Application, whereby the page is loaded once, and the developer can acces and manipulate the data in the DOM.

```
