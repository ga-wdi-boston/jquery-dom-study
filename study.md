# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not a lanaguage and the DOM is not a server.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The information in our Dev Tools is in the DOM because the tools can display the DOM of our content.  For example, if you inspect the element of a webpage, it will show you the DOM structure of the site.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it is a hierarchical structure of any webpage.  By using that structure, it is easy to traverse elements of a site in relation to one another.
```
