# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not your HTML code that you wrote and is also not the code you see in the source code viewed from the browser's "view source" feature. The browser parses through your HTML code and creates the DOM.

```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
It is a visual representation of the DOM, but not the DOM itself. This representation of the DOM can be manipulated through Dev Tools in the browser.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM shows the current representation of the website as a tree-like structure, which allows you to easily navigate through the different elements, retrieve content, and manipulate the tree-like structure itself.
```
