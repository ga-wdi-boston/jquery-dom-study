# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
<!-- The DOM is not HTML code and it is not 'view source' from a webpage. -->
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
<!-- Yes, the information iside of the Dev Tools is the DOM. The Dev Tools show
how your browser interpreted the html code. -->
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
<!-- The DOM is important b/c it takes each element from the HTML file and
turns them into objects that the broswers can use to make a web page.-->
```
