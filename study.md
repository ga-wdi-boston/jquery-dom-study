# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is NOT:

1. The HTML you write -- although the DOM can correct any HTML mistakes when rendering.
2. View Source -- this is usually just a regurgitation of the HTML you wrote.

```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes (sort of?) The code inside DevTools is a visual representation of how the HTML
is rendered. I think the DOM refers more to the actual tree of nodes that helps
browsers map elements to a webpage though.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is definitely an important piece for allowing developers the ability to create
websites. Each of the nodes in the DOM is interpreted by the browser which is how it
figures out how render each piece of code into viewable content.
```
