# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not HTML and the DOM is not a webpage.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Sort of, the information inside the Dev Tools could be a representation of the DOM. It should be updating to include jscript etc that is passed through. It is still a visual representation of the DOM so depending on the browser and the tools you're using it may be altered from the actual DOM.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
It's critical because it's the core framework that other languages like HTML use to represent pages. Even if you're not editing the DOM directly you should know what it is and how it behaves if you want to have a better understanding of how and why you're doing certain things in html, javascript etc.
```
