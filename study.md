# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
DOM is not html, DOM is not Javascript.  It is a way to visually edit those things and load them into a web browser.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, the elements sections shows the RENDERED DOM for the elements within a page.  It shows the 'tree' of the nodes of those elements.  You can edit it but never save it.  Whis is what DOM is.  A tool to see what happens when you do this or that.```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
You need DOM if your website is interactive (which, 99% of websites are) otherwise you wouldn't be able to keep track of those interactions and their consequences (value? usability?)  It organizes very large things into a workable model.
```
