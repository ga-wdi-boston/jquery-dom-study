# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not your HTML, and the DOM is not the HTML in ViewSource.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The Dev Tools shows a visual representation of the DOM as it exists as you are
viewing the page.  It is not neccessarily the same as your HTML since you may have
a mistake that the browser is fixing for you, or if you have JavaScript elements that
can manipulate the page.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it represents the live version of an application, so
any JavaScript that manipulates or interacts with the page uses the DOM as a reference
because the DOM represents the most current version of whatever page you are viewing.
```
