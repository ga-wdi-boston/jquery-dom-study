## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not HTML nor CSS. It is simply a tree representing those elements from the file.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, when you inspect an element on a webpage -- the DOM is represented in the DEV Tools
because the browser is giving you a live-snapshot of how it translated the HTML that you wrote for the page.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is very important because it aids browsers in translating the HTML document to quickly find
HTML elements with Javascript.
```
