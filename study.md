# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
the DOM IS NOT an html file alone, nor is the DOM a JavaScript file
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
YES, in a way because it renders the DOM in it.
It shows it within the Dev tools so that you can edit it live.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
To understand the organizational hierarchy of a Document that is going through a web page.
to see the different files in a structured format to see how they relate to eachother can
help to have you understand whats going on when you are linking different files to eachother--
say though linking a JavaScript file to an HTML file you can see visually and spatially how they
are connected and what each are coming from.
```
