# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not a webpage viewed by the user of a website. It allows the developer
to analyze the internals of the structure of a webpage.

The DOM does not update itself, it is static.  To give a webpage a dynamic look
and feel, we use jquery to manipulate the DOM, updating, adding or deleting
parts of the DOM to make a webpage dynamic
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
It is a resprensation of the DOM.  It does not include all the details that
show the node object values. The Dev Tools allows the developer to debug things
that are not working as expected and allows quick changes.
These changes then need to be added permanently to
the files making up the site.

```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The existence of the DOM allows us to interact with a web page. It gives us
the ability to change the look and feel of the page based on events that we can
register.  The DOM can be updated on fly(nodes added/removed/changed) from it's
original structure when first launched, allowing web pages to have a dynamic feel to them.
```
