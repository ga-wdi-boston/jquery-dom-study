# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
its not the html and and its not Javascript. html can viewed as the base/foundation model of DOM and
Javascript can be viewed as the manipulator of DOM.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, dev tools are the visual representation of DOM, and it will look like your html file in most cases.
It can be a different format when mistakes are made inside the html and the browser fixes them for you, thus,
displaying a different representation of the DOM in comparison to the html
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
it grants access to documents and elements within the documents. Without it, one will not be able
to manipulate the source within with Javascript. Javascript is just a programming language, thus, it doesn't have access to the net, but with DOM it can do whatever possible mind can think of.
```
