# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
1. A language dependent interface.
2. An exact framework of the HTML.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
To quote CSS-tricks, "Yep. Kinda."  It represents the live code on the page
and can be affected by scripts and the browser unlike the source HTML.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
  The DOM is important because is allows easy navigation on the HTML on a webpage
  that may be even clearer than if you were to look at the source HTML because
  it includes changes made to the HTML from scripts or other sources.
```
