# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM, document object model, is NOT the html that you write.
The DOM is also NOT the view source, that is still just the html.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
It is a visualization of the DOM tree.  Mostly, yes it is. ```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it is what makes javascript (and JQuery) work.  It is what makes web pages responsive.   If there was no javascript the different between the DOM and html wouldn't really matter that much, but javascript and JQuery and the DOM and html all combine to mean to you can gather data and manipulate a web page based on user responses and input.```
