# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
It is not language-specific.
It is not a rendered page.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Not entirely sure on this one, but I think no. The DOM is the structure model or tree, but I don't think the info in it is inherently Dev Tools? Could be wrong on that.  

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
I think the DOM is important because it gives you an interactive way of editing nodes or content, pinpoint problems more efficiently by seeing real-time updates. Also, seeing the box-model parameters is super helpful.

Allows JS to interact with HTML and CSS
