# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not a duplication of your HTML (although it may look similar).
The DOM is not a programming language.

```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes.  In Chrome you can view the Elements panel.  It will show you everything in
the DOM tree and allow you to edit it.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
To me it seems like a blueprint for a webpage.  All browsers need to be able to use it in order
to render the page.  I guess it would kind of be like building a house without a
blueprint if you didn't have one.
```
