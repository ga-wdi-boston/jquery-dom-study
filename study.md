# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
<!-- In order to explain what the DOM is not, I will phrase what the DOM is. The Dom is
a Document Object Model(a tree structure) that allows us to connect with web pages and this connection serves
to let us modify the content of HTML documets.
The DOM is not a literal explicit HTML file
It is not a literal CSS file
It is not what we called as source in a website.
 -->
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
<!-- Yes, when we inspecg a website, we get a visual representation of the DOM that is as to say a visual
delineation of the DOM -->
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
<!-- Because that ia where Javascript events take place. Javascript is actually accessing and modifying the nodes in the DOM. -->
```
