## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
<!--

It is NOT the html you write
It is not the view source (which looks pretty much like the html you write)

It is not straight up javascript, html or css.


-->
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
<!--
Kinda. inside your Dev Tools you'll see a representation of object interactions inside your html document. It sounds like it's a representation of all of those things combined.

 -->
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
<!--

So let's say I add some javascript to my html but guess what? It's broken, or wrong or just plain needs to be changed because my javscript comfort level is equivalent to how comfortable I am writing this squished on a commuter bus. Using DOM you can use your dev tool view to go in and change things on the fly in your browsers dev tools.

DOM feels like the place where all the magic javascript things on the internet happen, the middlespace between the code you're writing and what it does on your finished web page.
