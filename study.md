# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
1. The DOM is not a programming language
2. The DOM and javascript are the same thing
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
I think you can see the DOM with Google Dev Tools because you can see the html structure when you tab over to the "elements tab". The elements tab default view is collasped to show all the element ids that the developer would have set in her html file.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it gives all web browsers a standard structure to follow when rendering web pages. Haivng a standard stucture makes developement easier because you can assume that all web browsers will be rendering pages according to the standard structure, so you don't have worry about making your structure different for different browsers. This saves a lot of development time and money.
```
