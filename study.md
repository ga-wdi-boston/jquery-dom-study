## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is NOT the HTML I write, or the "View Source" of a webpage. Nor is it a type of baked good.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
More or less. It's a visual representation of what the browser reads, which is the DOM.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is a common format for representing and interacting with HTML and other documents, across platforms and languages. It makes it much easier to write code for webpages that work.
```
