# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
1. The DOM is not a way of percisting objects to XML nor HTML. The
DOM specifies how XML and HTML documents are represented as objects.
2. The DOM is not a specification for a binary, however, programs written in the
same language will be source code compatible across platforms.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, as this is a visual representation of the DOM. This is unlike
"View Source" which just shows the HTML for a page.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM serves as a standard model to represent documents. This allows
documents to be programatically manipulated rather than just static pages.
The DOM is leveraged by JavaScript to load dynamically based on the user
and other inputs.
```
