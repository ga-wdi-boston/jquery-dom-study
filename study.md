# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not the HTML you write (the source) nor is it the final rendered/displayed bage.

Source: https:/./css-tricks.com/dom, and above
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes. This information includes not only the HTML as written, but also any changes or manipulations made to it by the browser or by javascript.

source: ttps:/./css-tricks.com/dom
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it gives us access to each piece of rendered HTML and allows us to make changes to it dynmaically using JS without needing to refresh a page or change the source HTML.
```
