# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not the html served to the browser.
The DOM is also not the code displayed when someone "views source".
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
The information inside Dev Tools is a visual representation of the DOM (which, as far as I understand it, is a data structure created by the browser) that uses
HTML syntax to represent DOM nodes.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
Javascript would be useless (at least on the front end) without the DOM because
it provides the programming interface for manipulating HTML documents, which,
without the DOM, are static documents.  The DOM makes it possible to manipulate
what is shown to the user in response to user actions and allows for more
robust and complex server-client interactions.
```
