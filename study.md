## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not your HTML, but is made up of your HMTL.

The DOM is not your Javascript.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
In a way, yes. The way your CSS, HTML, and other code is structed in there is your DOM, but the actual HTML and CSS code is not.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
A DOM is important because it allows the browser to interpert, correct, and make all your different code files compatible so they can be presented to the user in a reasonable way. 
```
