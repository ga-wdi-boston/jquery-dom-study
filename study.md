# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
DOM is not html, DOM is not Javascript.  It is a way to visually edit those things and load them into a web browser.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, the elements sections shows the RENDERED DOM for the elements within a page.  It shows the 'tree' of the nodes of those elements.  You can edit it but never save it.  Whis is what DOM is.  A tool to see what happens when you do this or that.```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
You need DOM if your website is interactive (which, 99% of websites are) otherwise you wouldn't be able to keep track of those interactions and their consequences (value? usability?)  It organizes very large things into a workable model.
```
