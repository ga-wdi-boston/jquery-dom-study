## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
HTML, a web page's source
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, sort of - it's a visual representation of DOM.  The DOM is what is acively being used by the browser to know how to display a web page, which incorprates HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery to know what to do.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
So a web page can function in the way the the developer intended, who wrote the instructions in HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
```
