# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
 the HTML we write
 the source of a webpage
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
yes because it's a visual representation of the DOM, it will look similar to HTML but it's not.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The document object model is important because it's where the code in javascript, html etc is brought to life and brought to the screen for people to see. The DOM provides the representation for the structure of a document and allows it to be accessed.
```
