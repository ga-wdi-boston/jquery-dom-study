# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The DOM is not the source HTML and it is not the source view of a rendered page in the
browser.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
DEV tools does display the DOM created using the source HTML. In most cases, this
will look very similar/exactly the same as the source HTML. There will be differences
between the DOM and the source HTML if there is included Javascript that manipulates an
element in the DOM. The DOM will reflect the change whereas the source HTML will not.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is very important when using Javascript to create events, animations etc. The
DOM is used to isolate the parts of the website where these changes need to be applied.
```
