## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
the DOM is not:
* your HTML code
* 'View Source'
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
'Kinda'. This is a visual representation of the DOM.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
One of the rasons the DOM is important because JavaScript can manipulate
the DOM by creating, changing, and removing HTML elements that didn't exist in your
original HTML code.
```
