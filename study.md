## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
The HTML you write or "view source" which is the html that the page is composed of.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
It is the DOM in the sense that the DevTools shows a visual representation of the DOM.  It isn't the DOM in the sense that it is just like the HTML code.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it acts as a medium between the HTML code and Javascript/JQuery/other languages so that they can operate on the HTML.    
```
