# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
DOM is NOT...
1. a computing language
2. a framework
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
No. It is a visual representation of the DOM.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM is important because it is allows you to change the structure, style, and content of your document (your code), by accessing each node, each of which represent a live object. As we learned in WDI Fundamentals, this is
known as accessing, traversing and manipulating the DOM.
```
