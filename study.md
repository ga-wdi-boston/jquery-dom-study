# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

The DOM is not HTML and it is not a rendered page. It is, however, derived from HTML. The DOM is also not what you see when when you hit 'View Source' in your web browser.

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

The information inside of the Dev Tools is a visual representation of the DOM. So technically it isn't the DOM but gives the developer an idea of what the DOM looks like. Often it looks exactly like our HTML but can change as it is rendered for example if there are certain errors in our HTML code.

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

The DOM is important because it allows developers to dynamically change the content of an webpage using JavaScript or jQuery. It allows for further customization, creativity, and interactability when designing web pages.
